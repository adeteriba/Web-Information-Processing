I develop an HTML/CSS/JS application to present hypothetical student assignment grades using an online styled table. 
The initial table should contain columns for the students' names (Name), ID numbers (ID),  Assignment 1, (a grade between 0-100 for this assignment), 
together with a Final Grade column that contains the arithmetic average of the assignment grades in the preceding columns.
