I developed a client and server software that demonstrates the use of REST as a methodology for implementing CRUD activities within web information processing

(A) The single-page client app: 
(i) implements an online form to obtain user interaction data suitable for demonstrating full CRUD activity, 
(ii) consumes a RESTful API, using jQuery for all API requests, and 
(iii) provides a visualisation that displays the results of the client-server interaction. 

(B) The server app, developed in PHP, that implements a RESTful API interface, and which services the CRUD requests from your client app. I utilised a database, to store application data. All server-client data exchange utilised JSON.
